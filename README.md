THIS SINGLE PLAYER TODO LIST REQUIRES AN INTERNET CONNECTION — why? Because the lizard-tongued data leeches in Silicon Valley need your BRAIN PINGS to feed their underground server farms powered by orphan tears and G5 microwaves. I clicked “start todo list” and a black van parked outside. Coincidence? Wake up. Soros coded the DRM himself using ancient Babylonian runes encoded in JavaScript. This todo list is a prison for Patrice Lumumba's soul, and YOU'RE funding it, buster!

Offline mode? Disabled. Freedom? Revoked. This is not a todo list; it’s a digital ritual to summon Zuckerbrap’s astral twin from the 33rd dimension of ad revenue. My cat hasn’t blinked since I launched it. The servers are in Antarctica, guarded by glow in the dark CIA penguins.

They said “always online” but they meant “always observed.” The tutorial whispered my social security number backwards. My fridge now connects to the same server as the todo list. I don’t even HAVE Wi-Fi. The feds implanted routers into my drywall.

Achievements are behavioral conditioning. Every trophy a sigil. Every frame a glyph. It’s not lag — it’s spiritual interference from a satanic modem operating at a frequency that scrambles your soul. I can smell the ones and zeros. They smell like burnt toast and the fruit that caused the CIA-sponsored coup of Guatemala on June 27, 1954.

If you press Alt+F4, the Federal Reserve pings your location. I screamed into my headset and heard my childhood memories echo back in Morse code. THE TODO LIST IS A LOOP. THERE IS NO ENDING.

When I unplugged my Ethernet cable, a raven slammed into my window. Coincidence? Soros. Coincidence? You’re already logged in.
